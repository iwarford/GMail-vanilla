# GMail-vanilla
Fork of the GMail addon for World of Warcraft 1.12.1

Rename the folder to Interface/Addons/GMail

The only difference between this and the previous version is that this doesn't set a message body when sending mass mails, so the mail is deleted from your inbox as soon as you take the item (not leaving behind an empty message in the mailbox).
